The game of snek!

Hopefully anyone reading this is familiar with what's going on here - This is my ongoing attempt to reproduce the classic game 'snake' using only Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It's available at https://bk-snek.netlify.app - at the time of writing its pretty rudimentary, although most of the fundamental game mechanics seem to to work. The main (massive) exception to this is that I haven't added the random generation of blocks for the snake to eat yet - pressing 'q' simulates this by increasing the length of the snake by 1. 

I have no idea if there's any copyright stuff here - credit to whoever owns / came up with snake I guess?
