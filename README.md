The game of snek!

Hopefully anyone reading this is familiar with what's going on here - This is my ongoing attempt to reproduce the classic game 'snake' using only Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It's available at https://bk-snek.netlify.app - at the time of writing it's pretty rudimentary, although most of the fundamental game mechanics seem to to work. At the moment the game basically just freezes when you lose, so take a note of your score and refresh the page to try and beat it!

I have no idea if there's any copyright stuff here - credit to whoever owns / came up with snake I guess? Also credit to whoever originally designed the the little snake picture in the favicon.

Worth noting that this doesn't yet work on mobile - I'd prefer for swipes to work rather than buttons, which is likely to take me a while to wrap (snake pun?) my head around.
